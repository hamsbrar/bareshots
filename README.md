# Bareshots Website

A custom-built website developed using PHP and JavaScript for a professional photographer.

> **Note:** This project was originally developed 4 years ago. The Git history has been reset due to privacy concerns—some earlier commits contained personal references to the client. To respect their wishes, I cleaned the repo and re-uploaded the code.

## Installation

1. Copy all files to your local server directory (`localhost/bareshots`).
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/bareshots`.
